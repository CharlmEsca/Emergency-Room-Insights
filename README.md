# Emergency-Room-Insights
## The goal of this project is to measure various metrics of an emergency room to seek out areas of improvement for the performance of the emergency room 

## Dataset
9000+ rows of Real World Fake Data (RWFD) emergency room data from data.world was used containing variables pertaining to emergency room wait times and patient demographics

## Inisghts Summary
In connection to the details mentioned above, the key metrics measured are pertaining to wait time, patient demographics, and also patient satisfaction

### ER Wait Time
- The time period of longest wait times were seen from January 2020 to March 2020
- The average wait time was approx. 35 minutes

### Patient Satisfaction
- The average patient satisfaction score over the time period of the data was approx. 5/10
- No correlation between waittimes and patient satisfaction was found

### Patient Demographics
- Patients aged 0-18 were of most abundant at the ER
- Patients aged <65 were least abundant at the ER
- The speciatly with the highest referral is General Practice

## Recommendations
- Since General Practice is the most referred specialty, perhaps a lack of general practitioners is what causes this trend.
- Thus, the hospital could advise patients to get a family doctor to lessen patient traffic at the ER that could be attended to by General Practice provided there is no shortage of general practicioners
- This could help lessen the waittimes
